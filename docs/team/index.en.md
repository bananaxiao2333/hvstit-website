## **Team Introduction**

The Victoria Harbour Science and Technology Innovation Team was born from the urgent need for hardcore technology practice on campus. We are not dreamers, but a group of practitioners who firmly believe in "making dreams come true through hands-on work." Facing the gap in aerospace engineering within the campus science and innovation field, we spontaneously assembled to form this team with **interdisciplinary integration capabilities**. The core mission of the team is to experience the **complete engineering process** from conceptual design, simulation, component manufacturing to system integration and test launches through the specific project of "Campus Panoramic Aerial Rocket."

We view this project as a valuable exploration, which is not only a technical challenge but also a comprehensive embodiment of team collaboration spirit, project management capabilities, and innovative thinking. Our ultimate goal is to leave unique high-altitude panoramic images for the campus and use this as a foundation to strive for official recognition from the school, establish a specialized science and innovation team, and contribute to the construction of campus technological innovation culture.
