# Lin Zhiyang

Team Leader & Project Initiator
 
As the core coordinator of the project, Lin Zhiyang leads the formulation of the overall planning and implementation blueprint for the three major projects: rocket launch, smart campus system, and optical fiber computer conceptual design, clarifying the goals, timelines, and resource allocation schemes for each phase. During the process, he proactively coordinates cross-project collaboration matters, organizes team members to conduct brainstorming sessions for key challenges such as technical difficulties in rocket launch, functional implementation of the smart campus system, and conceptual materialization of the optical fiber computer, synchronously tracks the progress of each project, and promptly resolves disagreements and obstacles during execution. Additionally, he assists team members in improving technical documents, plan details, and outcome optimization for each project, ensuring the efficient advancement of the three major projects under a unified framework and ultimately achieving expected goals.
