Testing Verification & Control Execution Specialist
 
Undertaking the testing and practical control tasks for the three major projects, ensuring the effectiveness of project implementation. In the rocket launch project, he participates in ground static testing, propulsion system performance testing, and real-time control during the launch process, recording launch data and analyzing optimizations; after the smart campus system construction is completed, he conducts individual testing of functional modules (including access control management, environmental monitoring, information release, etc.), performs stress testing by simulating actual usage scenarios, while being responsible for the control and problem feedback during daily trial operation of the system; for the demonstration program of the optical fiber computer conceptual design, he conducts logical integrity testing and operational stability verification, improving concept demonstration effects through repeated control debugging, providing first-hand testing data for project optimization.
