## Rocket Model Specifications

| Model | Key Dimensions (cm) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weike-0 (Experimental)** | Body length: 53.9<br>Other characteristic dimensions: 11, 52 | No test flights conducted | Marked as "Test" in notes. This data may correspond to early test models used for design verification. |
| **Weike-1 (Experimental)** | Tail fins/tail section length: 10.8<br>Body length: 52<br>Height from launch pad to nose cone: 48 | First test flight, successfully launched | Marked as "No. 1" in notes. These are basic dimensions of first successfully test-flown rocket. |
| **Weike-2** | Tail fins/tail section dimensions: 10.8, 61.4, 60.3 | Self-developed housing, successfully launched | Marked as "No. 2" in notes. Features self-developed housing with more complex dimensional data, possibly involving wingspan or different section lengths. |
| **Weike-1 (Production)** | Tail fins/tail section length: 10.8<br>Body length: 52<br>Height from launch pad to nose cone: 48 | Improved from experimental version, successfully launched | Improved from experimental version, specific dimensions may be optimized from the base design. |
