# Rocket Launch Project

Modified from: Victoria Harbour Science and Technology Innovation Team "Campus Panoramic Aerial Rocket" Project Proposal

## Project Background and Significance

Under the national advocacy for technological innovation and emphasis on cultivating students' practical abilities, there remains a gap in campus teams with complete innovation cycle capabilities. The Victoria Harbour Science and Technology Innovation Team focuses on the aerospace engineering field, planning to develop a controllable small rocket using the OP-25 engine as the core power source, aiming to fill the gap in campus innovation and demonstrate the team's interdisciplinary integration and engineering practice capabilities.


The project's core objective is to launch the rocket to an altitude of 100-200 meters and capture campus panoramic images through a mounted panoramic camera. Compared to high-altitude drones, this solution offers better cost-effectiveness in terms of equipment costs, endurance limitations, and high-altitude stability, while accumulating technical experience for subsequent campus high-altitude monitoring and remote sensing applications. This lays the foundation for the team to gain official school recognition, establish a specialized innovation team, and contribute to the construction of campus technological innovation culture.

## Project Core

### 1. Core Power and Control System: The "Heart" and "Brain" of Precise Flight

As the core control center for stable rocket operation, this system uses the OP-25 engine as the dedicated power source, providing continuous and stable thrust output for the rocket, ensuring sufficient and controllable power supply from the source, akin to equipping the rocket with a powerful "heart."

Matching this is the independently developed and debugged flight control system. After multiple rounds of testing and optimization, this system can capture real-time data on the rocket's position, speed, and attitude during flight, precisely calculating and adjusting engine thrust and rocket body attitude to effectively counteract external influences such as airflow interference and gravity deviations, ensuring the rocket always follows the preset trajectory with stable attitude, serving as the "intelligent brain" controlling rocket flight.

### 2. Key Mission Objectives: Dual Breakthroughs in High Precision and High Practicality

Mission objectives focus on two core aspects: "precision" and "practicality":

- **Precise Altitude Flight**: Clearly requires achieving precise altitude flight at 100-200 meters, imposing extremely high demands on the rocket's power control and altitude detection accuracy - requiring real-time calibration of altitude errors during flight to ensure the final hovering or landing altitude deviation from the target altitude is controlled within a minimal range, reflecting the project's strict standards in control precision.
- **Panoramic Imaging**: Relying on the panoramic camera mounted on the rocket body, complete the full capture of campus panoramic images. This camera features wide-angle and high-resolution capabilities, covering entire campus scenes including buildings, greenery, and sports fields, not only preserving high-definition, complete spatial image data for the campus but also extending rocket technology from "flight testing" to "practical application," giving the project stronger practical value.

### 3. Phase Key Work: The "Critical Roadmap" for Orderly Advancement

Project advancement follows a clear phase planning. The current key milestone of flight control program development and debugging has been successfully completed, meaning the rocket's "brain" now possesses complete functionality, laying the software foundation for subsequent hardware integration and flight testing, representing an important milestone in project advancement.

Subsequent work will proceed logically from "design to implementation":

1. **Rocket Body Structure 3D Modeling**: Precisely plan the dimensions, materials, and assembly relationships of rocket body components through digital design, ensuring structural strength and aerodynamic performance meet standards.
2. **Component Production**: Process core components such as engine mounts, rocket body shells, and camera mounting devices according to modeling standards.
3. **System Integration**: Integrate power, control, camera, and other systems into a complete rocket body.
4. **Launch Testing**: Verify the synergy of all systems through launch testing, achieving project objective closure.
