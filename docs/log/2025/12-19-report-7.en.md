# Project Seventh Week Progress Report

This week's core advancement tasks focused on rocket assembly and solid fuel formulation debugging, with各项工作按计划有序开展. As of the weekend, all procured materials including rocket structural components, propulsion systems, and altitude sensor modules have arrived. Quality inspection confirmed that all component specifications meet design standards, with no dimensional deviations or performance defects.

## Material Arrival and Quality Inspection

As of the weekend, all procured materials including rocket structural components, propulsion systems, and altitude sensor modules have arrived. Quality inspection confirmed that all component specifications meet design standards, with no dimensional deviations or performance defects. All components underwent rigorous incoming inspection, including dimensional measurement, performance testing, and visual inspection to ensure compliance with design drawings and technical specifications. Inspection records of key components have been archived for traceability.

## Launch Test Schedule Adjustment

Due to Christmas holidays, intensive internal and external collaboration activities and limited laboratory access time this week, the originally scheduled first static ignition launch test of the rocket could not be conducted as planned. The project team has coordinated to reschedule the test to the first week after the holidays, simultaneously completing preliminary preparations including launch site registration, safety plan review, and data acquisition equipment debugging to ensure the test task can proceed smoothly after the holidays. Additionally, the project team has communicated and coordinated with relevant departments to ensure timely site access permission after the holidays.

## Breakthrough in Solid Fuel Independent Development

The research team achieved phased breakthrough in solid fuel R&D, completing formulation finalization and performance testing of a newly developed solid propellant. The fuel is formulated using agricultural potassium nitrate and sorbitol. This achievement represents a transformation from purchasing fuel to independent development, significantly reducing project costs while providing technical support for subsequent optimization and upgrading of the rocket propulsion system.

## Fuel Formulation and Performance Verification

During the development process of the new solid propellant, the team conducted multiple rounds of formulation adjustments and combustion performance testing. Agricultural potassium nitrate serves as the oxidizer, while sorbitol acts as both fuel and binder. When mixed in specific proportions, the two components demonstrate stable combustion characteristics and reliable thrust output. Laboratory test data shows that key parameters including burning rate, combustion temperature, and specific impulse all meet expected specifications, providing adequate propulsion assurance for the rocket.

## Cost Effectiveness and Technical Value

The successful independent development of solid fuel not only significantly reduces project costs but also enhances the team's technical autonomy. By mastering core fuel formulation technology, the team can flexibly adjust fuel performance parameters according to different rocket model requirements, achieving customized design of propulsion systems. This breakthrough also establishes an important foundation for project sustainable development and subsequent model development.

## Summary

The seventh week achieved important progress in material supply assurance and fuel technology R&D. Although holiday impacts led to test schedule adjustments, through advanced preparation work, we ensured that critical tasks can proceed rapidly after the holidays. The success of independent solid fuel development marks a significant step in core technology capability building, providing strong support for the smooth execution of subsequent tasks.
