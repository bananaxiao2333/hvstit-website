## Daily Progress

### November 10, 2025

- **Main Tasks Completed**: Finalized the 3D model design of the rocket and officially initiated the printing and preliminary assembly process for various components.
- **Detailed Progress**: Today marks the official transition of the project from the design phase to the physical manufacturing stage. The team conducted final optimizations and confirmations on the rocket's overall structure, aerodynamic profile, and internal component layout. The first batch of structural components is scheduled to begin 3D printing.
- **Next Steps**: The printing of the main components is expected to be completed within the next two weeks, followed by systematic ground assembly and electronic component testing.
