# Weike-1 Successfully Launched
At 1:08 PM this afternoon, the first rocket "Weike-1" developed by the Victoria Harbour Technology Innovation Group at JNU for Hong Kong and Macao's Students (ASJ), Yingdong Campus, was successfully launched. The rocket was launched as planned and successfully deployed its parachute. This test was completed two weeks ahead of schedule. During the three-week preparation period, our team conducted tests on 3D printing and prepared relevant chemical materials, achieving perfect success and making thorough preparations for Weike-2 and Weike-3.
