# Project Fourth Week Progress Report

This week: November 24, 2025 - November 28, 2025

## Progress Report

With the successful launch of "Weike-1" still fresh, the fourth week's R&D work has steadily advanced toward more precise and reliable directions. This week's core tasks focused on theoretical optimization of Rocket No. 2 and No. 3, while simultaneously initiating the physical design preparation for Rocket No. 2, inheriting the technical foundation of No. 1 while striving to break through performance bottlenecks.

### Theoretical Optimization Discussion

During the theoretical discussion phase, we clarified the improvement directions for No. 2 and No. 3. Addressing the insufficient flight attitude stability of No. 1, No. 2 plans to optimize the airframe structure proportions, adjust tail fin aerodynamic design, and add ballast. In our discussions, we repeatedly simulated the coupling relationships between aerodynamics-structure-control, using digital design thinking to organize optimization paths, ensuring every improvement has solid theoretical support.

### Rocket No. 2 Modeling Design

The modeling design of Rocket No. 2 was the key practical content of this week. We used professional design software to construct 3D models, detailing structural parameters from the airframe shell to internal component layout. During modeling, we not only needed to restore the theoretical design indicators but also consider manufacturing feasibility and assembly convenience, such as reserving adapter interfaces for sensor installation locations while optimizing internal wiring space to avoid line interference. After completing each module's design, we conduct cross-team validation, using visualization to promptly adjust unreasonable aspects, ensuring the virtual model meets both theoretical expectations and practical production requirements.

### Circuit Board Printing Implementation

The circuit board printing process was filled with rigorous operational details. When exporting manufacturing files from design software, we needed to carefully select key layers such as top-layer traces, silkscreen, and solder mask, confirm 1:1 scale, and repeatedly preview to check trace continuity and component packaging accuracy. During printing, we selected high-resolution mode to ensure clear traces, directly outputting top-layer files while mirror-processing bottom layers for convenient subsequent welding verification.

### Sensor System Upgrade

Preparation work for newly added altitude and velocity sensors progressed simultaneously. The reason for adding these two types of sensors is to more accurately capture rocket flight trajectory data, providing basis for attitude adjustment algorithm optimization. We compared the adaptability of multiple sensor models, focusing on measurement range, anti-interference capability, and installation dimensions. We have completed selection evaluation and are currently coordinating with suppliers to confirm supply details, ensuring sensors can perfectly integrate with Rocket No. 2's overall design.

## Summary

The fourth week's work proceeded orderly under the dual-track model of theoretical deepening and practical advancement, laying a solid technical foundation for the subsequent R&D of Rocket No. 2 and No. 3. Through systematic optimization design and precise engineering implementation, the team is steadily advancing toward higher precision and reliability goals.
