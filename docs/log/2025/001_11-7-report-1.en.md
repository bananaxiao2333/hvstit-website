## Detailed Progress

### 1. Core Technology Exploration and Structural Design
- **Systematic Knowledge Building**: Using "rocket overall R&D logic" as the starting point, built a foundational cognitive framework for rocket flight principles, core modules, and design specifications through studying professional literature, analyzing classic models, and reviewing cutting-edge cases.
- **Preliminary Plan Formation**: Team members collaborated with division of labor, conducting brainstorming and sketch design from key dimensions such as aerodynamic layout, structural strength, and functional module compatibility, forming the prototype of structural solutions.

### 2. Fuel Selection Feasibility Study
- **Specialized Seminar**: Invited chemistry team member [Xu Zihao](../../team/participants/xuzihao.md) to participate, deeply discussing the technical characteristics and application scenarios of liquid/solid/hybrid fuels based on key indicators such as power requirements, energy density, and safety.
- **Clear Technical Path**: Clarified core constraints and established a phased advancement strategy of "**first verifying basic fuel feasibility, then exploring new fuel optimization**", providing direction for subsequent breakthroughs.

### 3. Project Promotion and Achievement Documentation
- **Dedicated Webpage Setup**: Completed page architecture design, section division, and basic content population centered around "progress synchronization, achievement display, and team highlights".
- **Initial Launch**: Core pages have been deployed[^1], establishing an important platform for project external communication and result demonstration.

## Summary
The first week's work, through knowledge accumulation, cross-disciplinary communication, and practical exploration, has clarified the development path, laying a solid foundation for subsequent structural optimization, fuel R&D, and project advancement.
