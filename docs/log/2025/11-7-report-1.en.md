# First Week Progress Report of the Project

## Overview
During this period, the team proceeded in an orderly manner around the initial core tasks of the [Rocket R&D Project](../../projects/rocket/index.md), completing the key groundwork from conceptual understanding to preliminary practice.

## Detailed Progress

### 1. Core Technology Exploration and Structural Design
- **Systematic Cognition Building**: Starting with the "overall R&D logic of rockets", a basic cognitive framework for rocket flight principles, core modules, and design specifications was systematically established by studying professional literature, disassembling classic models, and sorting out cutting-edge cases.
- **Preliminary Scheme Formation**: Team members collaborated, conducted brainstorming and sketching from key dimensions such as aerodynamic layout, structural strength, and functional cabin adaptability, and formed a prototype of the structural scheme.

### 2. Feasibility Demonstration of Fuel Selection
- **Special Seminar**: [Xu Zihao](../../team/participants/xuzihao.md), a member from the chemical field, was invited to participate in an in-depth discussion on the technical characteristics and application scenarios of liquid/solid/hybrid fuels in terms of key indicators such as power requirements, energy density, and safety.
- **Clarified Technical Path**: The core constraints were clarified, and a step-by-step promotion strategy of "**first verifying the feasibility of basic fuels, then exploring new fuel optimizations**" was determined, pointing out the direction for subsequent research.

### 3. Project Publicity and Achievement Precipitation
- **Exclusive Webpage Construction**: Completed the design of the page structure, column division, and filling of basic content with the core of "progress synchronization, achievement display, and team style".
- **Preliminary Launch**: The core pages[^1] have been deployed, establishing an important platform for external communication and achievement display of the project.

## Summary
The work in the first week clarified the development path through cognitive accumulation, cross-border communication, and practical exploration, laying a solid foundation for subsequent structural optimization, fuel research and development, and project promotion.
