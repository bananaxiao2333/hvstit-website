# Project Third Week Progress Report

Week Period: November 17, 2025 - November 21, 2025

## Progress Report

This week, the team's core tasks focused on the preparation and execution of the "Weike-1" rocket launch.

### Preparation Phase

The team advanced the basic parameter debugging and component assembly of the rocket according to the established plan. During the parameter debugging phase, key indicators such as the power system threshold were repeatedly verified to ensure all data met the launch standards. In the component assembly process, the rocket structure was spliced strictly following technical specifications, while multiple rounds of testing were conducted to eliminate potential assembly risks.

### Launch Phase

At 1:08 PM on November 20, the "Weike-1" rocket was launched as scheduled. During the launch, all systems operated stably, and the rocket's attitude control was precise. The predetermined flight program was successfully completed, and the parachute deployment was achieved, resulting in a 100% mission success rate.

### Summary and Outlook

The successful launch of "Weike-1" not only validated the feasibility of the preliminary technical plan but also provided valuable field data and practical experience for the subsequent optimization of "Weigang-2" and "Weigang-3" rockets, parameter adjustments, and launch process improvements. This lays a solid foundation for the continuous advancement of the series of missions.
