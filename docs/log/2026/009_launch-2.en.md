### Launch Records
| Serial No. | Rocket Model | Fuel Type | Executor | Result | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Weike-1 | Fuel Type 2 | Principal Zhou | Ignition failure | First attempt |
| 2 | Weike-1 | Fuel Type 2 | Principal Zhou | Ignition failure | Second attempt |
| 3 | Weike-1 | Fuel Type 2 | Principal Zhou | Ignition failure | Third attempt |
| 4 | Weike-2 | Fuel Type 1 | Principal Zhou | Ignition successful, flight altitude 10.73m | Presumed overweight nose cone causing insufficient altitude |
| 5 | Weike-1 | Fuel Type 1 | Principal Zhao | Ignition successful, flight altitude 59.63m[^1] | Altitude sensor detached, parachute did not deploy |

### Analysis and Improvement Recommendations
#### Problem Summary
1. **Insufficient reliability of Fuel Type 2**: Three ignition failures, possibly related to the uniformity or combustion characteristics of self-made fuel.
2. **Structural design defects**:
   - Overweight nose cone (Weike-2) leading to limited flight altitude.
   - Nose cone wrapping too tight (Weike-1) affecting parachute release.
3. **Data recovery mechanism**: Sensor fixing method needs improvement to avoid detachment.

#### Future Plans
1. Suspend use of Fuel Type 2, prioritize testing prefabricated fuel (Fuel Type 1).
2. Optimize nose cone weight balance and front structure to reduce front-end mass.
3. Improve parachute compartment design to ensure deployment mechanism is not obstructed by wrapping.
4. Strengthen sensor fixing method, employ redundant fixing or cushioned design.
