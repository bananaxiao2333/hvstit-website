# Project Logs

## Purpose of Logging

This logging system aims to systematically record the project advancement process of the Victoria Harbour Science and Technology Innovation Team (VHSTIT), providing complete work records for team members while offering detailed evidence for subsequent project reviews and technical knowledge transfer.

## Content Scope

Log content covers key milestones throughout the project lifecycle, including but not limited to:

- **Project Initiation and Planning**: Records of project establishment, goal setting, resource allocation, and other initial work
- **Technical Development Process**: Detailed records of key technical breakthroughs, experimental data, and technical solution adjustments
- **Phased Achievements**: Important milestone accomplishments, technical verification results, and project progress reports
- **Problems and Solutions**: Technical challenges encountered during project advancement and their resolution processes
- **Team Collaboration Records**: Important meeting minutes, role adjustments, and collaboration mode optimizations

## Usage Instructions

All log entries are arranged chronologically and support classification retrieval by tags. Team members can quickly understand project history through the logging system, while new members can quickly integrate into the project environment through logs.
